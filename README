Xelig version 0.01
==================

Xelig is a Model-View-Controller Presentation Framework
inspired by Enhydra's XMLC. Unlike the other 36000 XML
XML Template Frameworks, Xelig aspires to offer a genuine
separation of layout and logic, data and design.

Documentation will trickle out shortamundo.

Model:	    

    The data to be exported into an XML (XHTML &c)
    visual representation

View:	    

    The visual 'skin' for that data

Controller: 

    An object generated from an XML file that governs
    how the Model is mapped into the View

The same piece of data (Model) can be given a variety of
different skins (Views).

Likewise the same View can be wrapped around a
number of different Models.

The linkage between the two is configured in the
Controller's XML 'patchbay'.
