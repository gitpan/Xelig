Revision history for Perl extension Xelig.

0.03  Fri Jul 04 12:53:19 2003
	- Fixed bug that caused corrupt output if
	  aliased content had leading or trailing space
	  e.g. <alias from="foo"> bar </alias>
	- Added new test (space_alias) to catch this in future
	- Added "anonymous" attribute to template element e.g.
	  <template id="foo" anonymous="false" />
	  (synonyms: "no", "0") to allow clones to
	  preserve their id attributes: supports
	  cases where the id itself
	  is being targeted
